# Development Progress

## Components Overview

This document tracks the development progress of the Python Script Packager components as defined in the architecture document.

## Development Schedule

| Component       | Status    | Description                                           | Priority |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `stdlib.py`     | Completed | Contains stdlib detection for filtering imports       | 1        |
| `collector.py`  | Completed | Recursively finds Python files in a project           | 2        |
| `parser.py`     | Completed | Parses imports using AST and strips import statements | 3        |
| `builder.py`    | Completed | Merges stripped code bodies and imports               | 4        |
| `__main__.py`   | Completed | CLI interface for the packager                        | 5        |
| `uv_wrapper.py` | Completed | Adds OS-aware shell and batch bootstrap               | 6        |
| `mapping.py`    | Completed | Optional import-to-PyPI mapping                       | 7        |

## Current Focus

All core components have been completed. The project is now ready for:

1. Final integration testing
2. Documentation review
3. Performance optimization
4. User feedback and refinements

## Completion Criteria

A component is considered complete when:

- Implementation matches the architecture specification
- Unit tests are written and passing
- Documentation is complete
- Code is reviewed and approved
