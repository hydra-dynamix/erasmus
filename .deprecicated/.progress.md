# Development Progress

## Components Overview

This document tracks the development progress of the Python Script Packager components as defined in the architecture document.

## Development Schedule

| Component       | Status      | Description                                           | Priority |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `stdlib.py`     | Completed   | Contains stdlib detection for filtering imports       | 1        |
| `collector.py`  | Completed   | Recursively finds Python files in a project           | 2        |
| `parser.py`     | Not Started | Parses imports using AST and strips import statements | 3        |
| `mapping.py`    | Not Started | Optional import-to-PyPI mapping                       | 4        |
| `builder.py`    | Not Started | Merges stripped code bodies and imports               | 5        |
| `uv_wrapper.py` | Not Started | Adds OS-aware shell and batch bootstrap               | 6        |
| `__main__.py`   | Not Started | CLI interface for the packager                        | 7        |

## Current Focus

Currently focusing on implementing the core components in order of dependency:

1. `stdlib.py` - Foundation for filtering standard library imports
2. `collector.py` - File collection system
3. `parser.py` - Import parsing and code stripping

## Completion Criteria

A component is considered complete when:

- Implementation matches the architecture specification
- Unit tests are written and passing
- Documentation is complete
- Code is reviewed and approved
