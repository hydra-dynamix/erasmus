To execute a runtime update redirecting emissions to a new treasury wallet
(5GZfkfjD46SmDrnWZbrzkxkYzeJUWKTAB1HvHBurrPc7XcEj) in Commune AI ' s
blockchain
, follow these steps :

Technical

Implementation

1. Locate Emission Logic
The emission mechanism is handled in the Subspace blockchain node (
commune-ai/subspace), a Substrate-based runtime. Specifically:
Emission logic resides in pallets/treasury/src/lib.rs or a custom pallet managing
token distribution [1] .
Identify the Treasury account ID configuration in the runtime (e.g., runtime/src/lib.rs).
2. Modify Treasury Address
Update the treasury account in the runtime configuration:
// In runtime/src/lib.rs
impl pallet_treasury::Config for Runtime {
type TreasuryAccount = EnsureAccountIdOf<5GZfkfjD46SmDrnWZbrzkxkYzeJUWKTAB1HvHBur
// ... other configurations
}

3. Build & Test
Follow Subspace's build instructions [1] :
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/commune-ai/subspace
cargo build --release
# Run tests
cargo test -p pallet-treasury --test emission_tests

Governance Process
1. Submit Proposal
Draft a governance proposal detailing the change and host it on IPFS (e.g., via Pinata)
[2] .
Use the CommuneX CLI to submit the proposal:
c network submit-proposal --cid <IPFS_CID> --key <WALLET_KEY>

This burns proposal_cost tokens, refundable if the proposal passes [2] .
2. Community Voting
Stakeholders vote via the Community Proposals platform, with voting power
proportional to their stake [2] .
Monitor voting status using:
c network list-proposals

3. Runtime Upgrade
If approved:
Validators deploy the updated runtime using sudo or a democratic governance module.
Confirm the upgrade via on-chain extrinsics:
c network runtime-upgrade --wasm <NEW_WASM_BLOB> --key <VALIDATOR_KEY>

Key Considerations
Testing: Ensure backward compatibility and test on a testnet first [1] .
Documentation: Update emission policies in the Commune docs [3] .
Security: Audit the new wallet's configuration to prevent typos or vulnerabilities.
For detailed CLI commands, refer to the CommuneX governance subcommands [2] .
