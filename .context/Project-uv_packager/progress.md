# Development Progress

## Development Timestamps

| Sprint | Start Time | End Time | Duration |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Sprint 0 | - | - | (2h target) |
| Sprint 1 | - | - | (4h target) |
| Sprint 2 | - | - | (4h target) |
| Sprint 3 | - | - | (4h target) |

Project Start: 2025-04-12T08:30:44-07:00
Project End: TBD

**Instructions for Developers:**
1. Update the start time when beginning each sprint
2. Update the end time upon sprint completion
3. Calculate and record actual duration
4. Note any significant deviations from target times

## Components Overview

This document tracks the development progress of the Python Script Packager components.

## Development Schedule

| Component | Status | Description | Priority |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `stdlib.py` | Not Started | Standard library detection and filtering | 1 |
| `collector.py` | Not Started | Python file discovery and filtering | 2 |
| `parser.py` | Not Started | Import analysis and code manipulation | 3 |
| `mapping.py` | Not Started | Import to package name mapping | 4 |
| `builder.py` | Not Started | Script generation and assembly | 5 |
| `uv_wrapper.py` | Not Started | Platform-specific bootstrapping | 6 |
| `__main__.py` | Not Started | CLI interface and orchestration | 7 |

## Current Focus

Starting with foundational components in dependency order:

1. `stdlib.py` - Core functionality for filtering standard library imports
2. `collector.py` - File system operations and filtering
3. `parser.py` - AST-based code analysis

## Completion Criteria

A component is considered complete when:
- Implementation matches the architecture specification
- Unit tests achieve >90% coverage
- Documentation includes API reference and examples
- Code passes linting and type checking
- Peer review is completed and approved
- Integration tests pass
